# COVID-19

## My Data Analysis Project - Source Code
Found at https://dillonbarker.github.io/COVID-19-UK/.

### What I did
I used web scraping to get data from a number of sites on the UK to do with COVID. I then converted these into the same file types and cleaned the data removing any imperfections using python.

I then used Qlikview a dashboarding software to display the data.
